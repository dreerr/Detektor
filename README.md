# Detektor & Observers

Using a camera and a facial recognition software, the visitors become part of the work. The visitors look into faces, and at the same time the observing gaze of these faces, and thus ultimately that of the installation itself, falls on them.

## Overview

The project consists of two main components:

- **Detektor**: Single channel version with configurable rows and columns.
- **Observers**: Multi channel version with configurable rows and columns.

The project raises questions about surveillance, technology, and the relationship between humans and digital systems.
