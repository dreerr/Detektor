A camera and facial recognition software integrate visitors into the artwork. As they look at faces, they become aware of being observed in return. The key moment occurs when they recognize their own faces among those watching, making them both observer and part of the installation. This reveals the workâ€™s function of collecting and displaying faces while blurring the boundary between viewer and artwork.

## Overview

The project consists of two main components:

- **Detektor**: Single channel version with configurable rows and columns.
- **Observers**: Multi channel version with configurable rows and columns.

The project raises questions about surveillance, technology, and the relationship between humans and digital systems.
